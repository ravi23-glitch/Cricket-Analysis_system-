# Cricket-Analysis_system-
This project is a command-line cricket analysis system built using Python and SQLite database.
It helps manage cricket player records (matches, runs, wickets) and provides simple analysis like:

1.➕ Add player performance data

2.📋 View all players

3.✏️ Update player details

4.🗑️ Delete player records

5.📊 Analyze performance (highest run scorer, best bowler, average runs per match)

The project uses SQLite for data storage, so all records are stored permanently in a local database file.
